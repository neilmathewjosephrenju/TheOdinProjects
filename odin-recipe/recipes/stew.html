    <h1>Viking Stew</h1>
    <img src ="download.jpg" alt="image">
    <p>This Viking stew, made with meat, berries, mushrooms, plenty of fresh herbs, and root vegetables typically available to the Vikings, is a seemingly primitive dish with a remarkably sophisticated flavor. It works with any meat, so if you cannot hunt for wild boar, do not be dismayedâ€”you can still make it!</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
